<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Software Engineer with 5+ years experience working in commercial R&amp;D environments on software quality and security tools. Experience with a wide range of programming languages, tools and methodologies.</p>
<p>From my experience working in a start-up, I have been directly exposed to customers, their needs and issues. The experience I gained from this I have translated into a strong customer focus in all my work. Subsequently being part of a larger organisation allowed me to continue this focus, as well as gain other skills and experiences in working on large commercial R&amp;D projects. This experience also gave me the chance to mentor and grow a large team of engineers as well as enhance my project management skills.</p>
